Hi, I’m Yiting — a physicist-turned-data scientist with a curious mind and a passion for solving complex problems. I earned my PhD in Physics on full scholarships, and since then, I’ve worked across academia and industry in the US, Switzerland, and now the Netherlands.

My path into data science began with a love for uncovering patterns and making smarter decisions through data. Today, I work in tech, focusing on experimentation, machine learning, and product insights that drive impact.

Outside of work, you’ll often find me climbing, skiing, or exploring the outdoors — especially in the Alps. I believe learning is lifelong, and I enjoy sharing what I know to help others grow.

This site is where I share my projects, thoughts, and favorite resources in data, science, and learning. Thanks for visiting!
